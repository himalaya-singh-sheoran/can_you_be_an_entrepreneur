# can_you_be_an_entrepreneur
I've made this using app using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). In short it is a great framework for those who don't know langauges for frontend development. You can code everything in python.
I've used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/namanmanchanda/entrepreneurial-competency-in-university-students) dataset. I've trained a knn classifier to make predictions.
Learn more about knn [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVXime0nQeI).

To use the app in local runtime. Donwload all the files.
```python
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
Then,
```python
streamlit run app.py
```
